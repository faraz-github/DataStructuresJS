// Hash Table
// A hash table, also known as hash map, is a data structure that is used to store key-value pairs.
// It is generally used for fast lookup to the value compared to other similar structures.

// A hashing function accepts the string key, converts it into a hash code using a defined logic and then
// and then maps it into numeric index that is within the bounds of an array.

// Using the index, store the value
// The same hashing function is reused to retrieve the value given a key.

// Main operations of Hash Table
// a) Set
// b) Get
// c) Remove

// Main Applications
// a) Database indexing
// b) Caches

// Side note: map is better than objects
