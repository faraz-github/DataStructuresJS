// Graph
// graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of a finite number of vertices(nodes) connected by edges.
// trees are specific type of graph data structure
// It can be of two types
// - Directed (Edges have a one direction for traversal)
// - Undirected (Edges are bidirectional to traverse)
// They may contain
// - Only nodes
// - Edges from a node
// - Cycles
// - Self loop
// - Disconnected nodes
// - It may contain waits on the edges (Cost of traversal)
// EXAMPLES
// - Google Maps
// - Social Media Sites

// Code Representation of a graph structure
// Graph is usually represented by adjacency matrix adjacency list

const matrix = [
  [0, 1, 0],
  [1, 0, 1],
  [0, 1, 0],
